In Subversion, arc diff sends the uncommitted changes in the working copy for review.

To create a revision in SVN:

3334
test1
test2
test3
test4

However, this is a relatively advanced feature. The default is usually correct if you aren't creating branches-on-branches, juggling remotes, etc.


test5
test6
test7
test8
test9
